My answer is purely based on my understanding of the concept.
this part contains day 1  all 3 task.
                                    
                                    Write a blog on the Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

My answers:  
 BEFORE GO THE DIFFERNECE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS $ HTTP $ 
 LETS SEE, 
  in simple event we undertsand what is HTTP.
   $ WHEN WE go to the coffe shop or hotels you send request (choose order) to the server then he or she gava what yoy want .This best example of http.This place you           are the client send send request to the server.
 * HTTP means HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL. 
  
  * In simple term two coputers or servers talk to each other.With help  of request and response.
  
 * USES: we can (CLIENT, ex browser:) make a request to the server to access the data from the web server.

 * it is used in the client-server communication
 
 * It is set of rules and regulation to transfer the data.

 * In  HTTP1.1 all requests and responses are simple text form or message format.

 * In HTTP2 all requests and responses are binary formats. Example. Cut the data into smaller packets.
.

 *  HTTP 2 offers more security and protection than HTTP 1.1.

  * In HTTP 2 Client can receive more data in a single response.
 
  * In HTTP1.1 server wait for the client to receive the first response then the server sends another response, it takes more time to share the data.
 
  * Compare to HTTP 1.1 latency is lower in HTTP2. 
  
  * Main difference  betwween the HTTP IN HTTTP 2 is REQUEST MULTIPLEXING,
   
   EXAMPEL : IN HTTP 1; client send multiple request to the server,
           * http1 wants multiple tcp connection to the server,
        client       tcp
        html request --------- -------------------> server
                        
        css  reques  ---tcp-------------------------> server
        jquery request ---- tcp------------------------> server
        api (call) request ---- tcp------------------------> server
        
        
       EXAMPEL HTTP 2 client send SINGLE  request with SINGLE TCP CONNECTION  to the server, and get  muliple number of data  from the server. that is SYNCHRONOUS;
       
       client     html, css,api, jquery  ----------------------------------------- > server
                             
       
        
        
 SOME ADDED INFORMATION:

  * HTTPS  [HYPE TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE] is advance version of the HTTP, https is more secure  than mormal http.
  
  * Advantage of the HTTPS is request and response are in the form of encryption and decryption,so client (browser have the option th decryet the response.

2)        Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.
           This answer is based on my ZEN class understanding without browsing.

My blog 
1)   OBJECTS  contains keys and values or pair

2)   we can access all the values in the object using keys [].

3) Object also contains child objects or nested objects.

4)  using the KEYWORD key  (KEYS IN THE OBJECT)  we can access all the keys present in the objects. Similarly using VALUES  we can access all the values present in the objects.

5) Object starts and ends with flower brackets or { } { } or curly brackets.

6) Array also comes under the object. I mean the type of array is an Object.

7) we can also access all the keys and values of the object dynamically and parallelly through for loop.

8) we can give string, numbers , booleans  , undefined, null, to the keys, i mean assigning  BOOLEANS, NUMBERS, UNDEFINED, NULL, to the keys.

9) It is better and good practice to use the [] square brackets than( DOT NOTATION)while accessing the values of the keys.

10) There is no position or index in the object-like array.

11) The main thing is we can give the unique key to the object.

12) we can add or assign new keys and values to the object.

3) code kata practice.

Beginning with Absolute beginner and zen,.
i made a consistency practice of code kata.from 6/1/2023 from now i practice two codekata problems daily;   

This is my first task submission i hope i gave my best answers,


--------------------------------------------
These points was taken from my zen class , some random search in googel and youTube and also my understanding;
